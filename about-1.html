      <h2>MY MAKE-UP JOURNEY</h2>
      <p>Growing up I had really ugly acne scars on my face,<br>
      I was in and out of Dermatologists because I couldn't<br>
    bare looking at my face in a mirror. That's when I fell<br>
  inlove with the beauty of the art of make-up, I felt like it had<br>
  restored my confidence back with make-up on my face I felt like<br>
  I didn't own any acne acne scars. Sooner or later I had to heal my<br>
  acne scars, so I'm still in the process of healing and removing<br>
  the dark spots left but my face is so much better than it was. <br />
  My business has been running for 5 years now, but when it<br />
  started I faced a lot of difficulties but as time passed I got<br />
  the hang of everything. My family has been supportive from the <br />
  word "GO" and I'm also planning on opening my first branch this year.</p>
